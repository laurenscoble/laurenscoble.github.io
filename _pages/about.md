    I love to tell stories and I want to help people. I'm passionate about creating things that will benefit and better people. My greatest strength is the ability to think outside the box and apply non-traditional solutions to sometimes complicated problems, with strategic insights, UX design and data visualisation.

    ### More Information

    I've had an eclectic career to date and it often shows in my approach to projects. I've been a web developer, a project and product manager, a people manager, a digital marketer, a UI and UX designer and a data person. There's nothing better for me than a new project that requires many of the skills that I have learnt over the years.
